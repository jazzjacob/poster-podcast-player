# Poster Podcast Player

## About the project

This is an ongoing project developed by me, that I started during the summer course "Applied Programming" at Karlstad University, 2024.

See the live site at: [posterpodcasts.com](https://posterpodcasts.com/)

## The idea, simply

A podcast player that can sync images with the audio.
